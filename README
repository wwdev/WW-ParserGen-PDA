WW-ParserGen-PDA

This package generates parser packages for use with WW::Parse::PDA::Engine.
The parsers are specified using a language similar to EBNF, but with
elements useful for driving the engine's PDA-based parsing.i

This tool set builds parsers that:

o Are intended for building abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
o Use recursive-descent from a starting rule
o Can use Perl code to perform input matching or other actions
o Provide an easy way to efficiently handle infix expressions
o Easily construct syntax trees using hash refs or objects
o Do not require a separate lexical analyzer to match tokens
o Can handle non-context free grammars

parser-gen-pda.pl process a specification file and then creates a Perl
package that contains all of the tables used by WW::Parse::PDA::Engine.
It can also create stub Perl AST classes (that use Moose) from rule 
definitions in the specification file.

The manuals for the parser generation process are in the
WW::ParserGen::PDA::Manual namespace:

Intro            - an introduction to the parser
Syntax           - a simplified EBNF version of the specification syntax
InfixExpressions - how to use the parser's infix expression features
CookBook         - some examples
